# David Berger's Senior Enrichment Project

I made a thing!

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Start the build process with: `npm run build-watch`
4. In another terminal, start your app with `npm start`
5. In yet another, seed your DB with `npm run seed`
6. The site should open in your browser, click the button to refresh and view!

### The Premise
I am the CTO of the United Assoc. of Interplanetary Campuses that are actually FSA People. I've created a RESTful web platform that allows one to manage students and campuses.

### The tools

I used sequelize, express, react, and redux when creating this app.
